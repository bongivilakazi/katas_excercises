Create a personal website to showcase your talents and ambitions.

The content and information you choose to display is up to you. There should be some information about your skills, interests, and previous experience, as well as information on how to get in touch with you. Think about the user experience when designing your layout and navigation.

The HTML and CSS should be developed in a logical way with good naming conventions that would allow another developer to easily understand and build upon your code.

Your web page files and folders should be organised and named in a logical manner.

Once you have finished your design and are satisfied with the style and content, upload the website to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

Requirements:

Website can be a single page or have multiple pages (the structure is up to you), but it must contain the following information:
About me
Skills (Your tech stack: the languages and tools you use)
Projects/Portfolio
Contact (social media, email, phone, etc)
Website must be responsive to different screen sizes - use a mobile-first approach!
Use CSS Grid (see tutorials below) to design your site and make it responsive
Website must be developed using HTML and CSS Grid with a logical structure and naming conventions in your code
Some basic JavaScript/Jquery should be integrated into the site in some way to make it more interactive and user-friendly
Feel free to use icons, colours, pictures or organograms if you need to
Create a board and make use of Trello which will assist you in breaking down your tasks
